Continue on line 59 of PointAndTeleport.cs (Working on the locomotion manager | Making a class for each locomotion method | Call enable to apply the new properties)

Call SetLocomotionControllers() then Enable() from LocomotionManager to Set active locomotion method

Add drop down menu to inspector for LocomotionManager to select the current active Locomotion method(call the relative funcs to disable the current method and enable the next)

(Perhaps figure out a better way of setting the component perameters for each Locomotion method[in inspector instead of code])
